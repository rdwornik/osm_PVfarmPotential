# OSM_PVfarmPotential
App in development...

App acquiring OpenStreetMap data to estimate solar farm potential on given territory. For research purposes 3 case scenarios were conducted:

1) Assuming fixed tilt angle that equals given latitude (recommended by NASA as default value)
2) Finding best tilt angle for given territory with optimization based on value of total power output divided by number of PV modules
3) Usage of external library PVLIB for handling power output calculations
